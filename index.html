Hi, welcome to Just Cause wiki! Thanks for your edit to the '''Talk:Poloma Renegade''' page.
<br>
Please leave a message on [[User talk:GMRE|my talk page]] if I can help with anything! [[User:GMRE|GMRE]] ([[User talk:GMRE|talk]]) 01:17, August 22, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
Thanks, How do you put in your location and occupation and stuff?? [[User:SomeRandomHuman|SomeRandomHuman]] ([[User talk:SomeRandomHuman|talk]]) 01:19, August 22, 2015 (UTC)

:You mean the big red table? That's called an "infobox". More info at [[Just Cause Wiki:Templates]]. For a userpage we have the [[Template:Infobox User]]. To put it on your page just copy the <nowiki>{{Infobox User}}</nowiki> to the top of your userpage and then save the page. When you edit the page again, you can add things to it.

==About sawed-off shotguns==
It is actually very rare for someone to use two shotguns at the same time because as a general rule, you never fire two shotguns at once without falling backward.

It just didn't make sense two have two full length shotguns.[[User:SomeRandomHuman|I&#39;m just that normal guy...]] ([[User talk:SomeRandomHuman|talk]]) 01:47, October 8, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
:They aren't full length. That much I can guarantee without seeing the weapon myself.
:If it were two full-length shotguns, then you would fly back at least 3 feet and land on your back from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoil recoil].
:But then again, Rico is no ordinary person. He can [[Dual Wield|dual wield]] [[:Category:Just Cause 2 Weapons|any one-handed weapon]].

Are you sure that's exactly what happened? Because that has never happened to me before.
<br>
And BTW, it's not mandatory, but it is not recommended to say that it was you who made that edit. I leave edits all the time and don't say that it was I who did it.

You can remove my name if you want. I think it might have to do with the Heat 2 I was at. But that was what happened.
The [[MV V880]]s, the reaper troops, everything was there. It defiantly happened.[[User:SomeRandomHuman|I&#39;m just that normal guy...]] ([[User talk:SomeRandomHuman|talk]]) 04:10, October 12, 2015 (UTC)

BTW, Saddex put his old name (Norrliang96 or whatever) on the Kem Signa Merkanam page for something.[[User:SomeRandomHuman|I&#39;m just that normal guy...]] ([[User talk:SomeRandomHuman|talk]]) 04:11, October 12, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
:Hmm... Then I might have to redo that mission several times
:[[User:SaddexProductions]]'s old name was Norrlanning96. But that edit on the [[Kem Singa Menerkam]] page was because a rare thing had happened there. Don't worry about it.

==[[Wire Mounting]]==
I actually don't know if this article should be created because technically these are part of [[Communications Mast]]s. But I guess you do have a point in that they are their own thing.
<br>
[[User:Anonymous230385|<span style="color:blue;">'''Anonymous'''</span><span style="color:red;">'''230385'''</span>]] [[User talk:Anonymous230385|<sup><span style="color:black">'''Any questions? Wanna talk?'''</span></sup>]] 14:12, October 20, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
:If the game itself mentions them separately, then there can be no question about their importance, but because they're obviously a part of another object, we could just move all the text into the [[Communications Mast]] article and redirect the [[Wire Mounting]] article to the correct section. Do the wires give any chaos points and money? [[User:GMRE|GMRE]] ([[User talk:GMRE|talk]]) 15:22, October 20, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
:Also, this little discussion should be taking place on the talk page for the wire mounting article, but whatever, I'm not gonna move it this time. [[User:GMRE|GMRE]] ([[User talk:GMRE|talk]]) 15:27, October 20, 2015 (UTC)
<br>
::You have a point about that page becoming a redirect... but I'm not sure
::About them giving chaos points and money... IDK. The only time I every destroyed one of these was at [[Gurun Lautan Lama Alpha]] and that was out of desperation.
::I will go check
